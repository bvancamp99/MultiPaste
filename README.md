<h3> Fix </h2>
- AudioItem is implemented, but a method of testing it is yet to be found.  Stream.Length might serve as a problem, since its documentation seems to imply that it's only supported in derived classes that use Length. <br></br>

- ImageItem.IsEquivalent <br></br>
- CustomItem.IsEquivalent <br></br>
- Keep menuStrip open when a toggle check item is clicked. <br></br>

<h3> Add </h2>

- Drag-and-drop support for raw images <br></br>
- If copying an image, give user the option to paste as a file or image <br></br>
- Sync support via peer-to-peer relay server <br></br>
- An improved look for the program icon <br></br>
- Support for storing image as its original format. <br></br>
