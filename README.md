<h3> Fix </h2>
<ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
  <li>AudioItem is implemented, but a method of testing it is yet to be found.  Stream.Length might serve as a problem, since its documentation seems to imply that it's only supported in derived classes that use Length.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Improve </h2>
<ul>
  <li>ImageItem.IsEquivalent</li>
  <li>CustomItem.IsEquivalent</li>
  <li>Keep menuStrip open when a toggle check item is clicked.</li>
</ul>

<h3> Add </h2>
<ul style="list-style-type:disc;">
  <li>Search algorithm!</li>
  <li>Drag-and-drop support for raw images</li>
  <li>If copying an image, give user the option to paste as a file or image</li>
  <li>Sync support via peer-to-peer relay server</li>
  <li>An improved look for the program icon</li>
  <li>Support for storing image as its original format</li>
</ul>
